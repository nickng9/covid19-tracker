It was my first go at learning React.js as well as implementing APIs, hooks, Chart.js as well as the Material-UI Framework.
The main thing I grabbed from this project/tutorial was learning how to manage React workflow, specifically creating clean components.

I followed this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls) and got to establish the fundamentals of React as well as branch out and learn more about axios, hooks, etc..
